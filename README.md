This repository contains the code for the paper: Characterising the asynchronous resurgence of common respiratory viruses following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic: a systematic analysis

All the fitting, analysis and figure generation can be run from "main.R". This loads in all the dependencies and functions. It has to be run in the order specified, and opens any files where manual edits can be made (e.g. type of simulation outcome). All the code and data (which is publically available) are in the repo, and can be run directly from the master script.
